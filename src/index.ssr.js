/**
 * This file is supposed to export a request handler, which implements server-side rendering in a Node.js runtime
 * environment.
 * 
 * In production, the request handler may be imported by an executable node script, which sets up an express server.
 * A sample script is provided in `react-scripts-with-ssr/scripts/serve.js`, which you may start with `npm run serve`
 * to test your production builds of the request handler. That script however is not part of the compilation. It is up
 * to you to implement, how the request handler is integrated in your server-side infrastructure.
 * 
 * This file may also export a function called `devServerHandler`, which is supposed to return a request handler for
 * the development environment. That request handler is plugged into the local webpack dev server started by `npm start`.
